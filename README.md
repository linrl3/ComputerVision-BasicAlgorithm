# ComputerVisionBasicAlgorithm

It's a collection of some basic algorithsm in image processing or computer vision in Matlab which are part of my assignments in the introduction class of computer vision. 

1.[Connected Component Labling](#connected-component-labling)

2.[Morphological operator](#morphological-operator)

3.[Histogram Equalization](#histogram-equalization)

4.[Color Segmentation](#color-segmentation)

5.[Canny edge detector](#canny-edge-detector)

6.[Hough transform](#hough-transform)

In each directory, we have source code of the algorithms and sample testing images. If you'd like to know more details and reasons, you're welcome to read the assiganments report in which there are more details on how to implement the algorithms.
